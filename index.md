**We shall boldy go...** *to Italy*
~~Not Trieste though~~ ***Turns out Trieste joined Italy in 1954***
Paraphrasing some Yugoslavian Communists, 
> This kinda blew

Completely unrelated, here's some code:
```
cat >HISTORYOFTRIESTE.txt 
git branch HISTORYOFTRIESTE.txt
git checkout HISTORYOFTRIESTE.txt
git push -u HISTORYOFTRIESTE.txt
```
See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trieste)

Some Pictures of or relating to Trieste! ![Trieste](Trieste!/405px-Trieste_collage.jpg)

![Flag](Trieste!/150px-Free_Territory_Trieste_Flag.png)

Many nations have controlled Trieste, including:
- Italy
- Austria-Hungary
- Yugoslavia
- Trieste (as a free state)

That's probably enough about Trieste. I've completed most of the lab:
- [x] talk about Trieste (My own addition)
- [x] satisfy parts 1, 2, and 3 of the lab itself
- [ ] Include a bit about myself in the User Page (part 3)

so:

I am 
1.  A Math-CS major
2.  3rd year here at UCSD
3.  Completing this class to get some experience with the software engineering field. 

Do let me know if you have any Italy-related projects :D
